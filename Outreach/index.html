  As a high energy physicist from a developing nation I am confronted by questions on the importance or relevance of my contribution. The usual response lies in pointing to the technological spin-offs of high energy physics - the PET scanner in our hospital or the World Wide Web. While that may quell further questions, I think it misses the mark. I think the primary contribution (as from most other fields of science) lies in shaping our worldview. We don't consider it a major contribution because it doesn't trickle through society far or fast enough - and that is a problem. In a world where the masses still cling to worldviews from the Bronze Age that sway geopolitics and hover its fingers over the red buttons of 21st century weaponry, this may well be our most critical problem. We can get away with it for a while with diplomacy, military deterrence and clever economic strategizing but without a strong dose of science outreach and education made available ubiquitously, this combustible mixture of ignorance and power, it seems clear to me, will sooner or later blow up in our faces.
