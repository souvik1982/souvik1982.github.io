    Exploration of all suggestions for improving selection criteria using vertex constraints. A method to quantify the significance of signal, if observed, is tested for bias using Monte Carlo methods. The yields and efficiencies of the denominator mode, i.e. Ds* decays to Ds gamma. Hit a brick wall in estimating the systematic uncertainty in reconstructing soft electrons by the method of missing mass. Forced us to change course on the matter. Backgrounds for all modes estimated and awaiting unblinding.

    An overview of the analysis strategy. Initial response to suggestions for vertex constraining tracks. Estimate of backgrounds and signal from data. Low energy electron tracking efficiency study.

    Introduced this analysis to the Cornell group focussed on the CMS experiment, with a brief introduction to the CLEO experiment. Backgrounds to the channel we're trying to discover, our analysis strategy, challenges in reconstructing extremely soft electrons and estimates for the background we will expect were presented.

    Updated predicted rate of signal. Outlined analysis strategy. Introduced the CLEO-c detector and a simulated signal event in it. Stacked signal and background plots for the selection criteria presented. Predicted signal and background events in 586 /pb of data.

    Problem with missed and new Ds-tags in the re-processed data solved upto the per-mill level. Sidebands in the DeltaM and m_BC suggest the Monte Carlo is off by a factor of 2.

    An EVTGEN plugin for a vector to scalar, lepton, lepton decay was used to simulate the signal. Parameterizing pion-fitted samples was shown to be inefficient and electron-fitting was motivated. Interdependence of kinematic variables allow us to get rid of DeltaE as a selection criterion. A prediction for data in the KKpi mode was made for both the pion and electron fits. The pi0 Dalitz decay background was discovered. A fit on Delta Phi to extract signal yield in data was demonstrated. A method to estimate the low energy electron tracking/reconstruction efficiency using Psi(2S) -> J/Psi pi0 pi0 was outlined with preliminary results. Missed and new Ds-tags in the re-reconstructed data was presented as a problem.

    An approximate theoretically predicted rate is mentioned. The conversion background that may resemble the signal is outlined. The problem with pion fitted electrons at low track momenta is discussed. Eight decay modes of the Ds+ are studied in Monte Carlo simulations for separating the sought signal from the conversion background. This is compared with 110 inv-pb of CLEO data to demonstrate the feasibility of this analysis.
