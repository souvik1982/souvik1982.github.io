A Brief Progress Report

--- PixelFEDSupervisor ---

1. VME 32 bit SpyFIFO 3 format converted to Slink 64 bit data format and looks similar outline in Common Data Formats document. How does the CRC work? Can we glean anything from those bits?
2. Slink 64 bit data format shipped to RU Builder and read out through a FU.

--- PixelSupervisor ---

1. Clean separation between GUI and functional XDAQ code. GUI is made out of HTML snippets stored in PixelSupervisor/interface/.
2. Expandable menu in the Halted State. (Nifty javascript allowed in the HTML) -- makes options for FED FIFO 3->RU or FED FIFO 3->File or FED FIFO 3->Screen

-- PixelFECSupervisor --

1. Has it's own GUI with low level commands like Prog_Pix, Cal_Pix etc
2. Can also respond to State Machine commands
(Testing with hardware stalled...)
