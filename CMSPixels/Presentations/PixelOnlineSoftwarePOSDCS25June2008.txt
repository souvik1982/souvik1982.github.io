Pixel Online Software - Detector Control Software Integration for Power Up Sequence
===================================================================================

1. Has worked from three conditions:

  a. Vdigi = 0 V    : PixelFECSupervisor waits in the "Configuring" state.

  b. Vdigi = 2.1 V  : PixelFECSupervisor programs the DACs, tries to check the currents (code not in), 
                      and sends a message to DCS to ramp up the voltage to 2.6 V.
                      It stays in the "Configuring" state.

  c. Vdigi = 2.6 V  : PixelFECSupervisor programs the DACs, Masks, Trims and TBM.
                      It goes to the "Configured" state.

2. If Portcard and CCU are OFF then the PixelTKFECSupervisor throws an exception and crashes out.
   It should wait in the "Configuring" state.

3. We wait 1 second after ramping up Vdigi to 2.6 V. More details on 1 second?

4. Should scale with mutiples modules, all 8 power partitions, and BPix. Not tested.

5. Code to check the currents in PixelFECSupervisor::readCurrent() needs to be written. Ben, Anders?

6. PixelDCSFSMInterface uses stray XML files which are unversioned. 
   It should get its parameters from the Configuration.xml file because that's versioned in RS 3. 
   Christian recognizes the importance but doesn't want to work on it. Ben?
