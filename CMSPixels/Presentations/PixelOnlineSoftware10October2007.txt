PIXEL ONLINE SOFTWARE REPORT - 10 October 2007

=== RUN CONTROL ===

Urged to move to RCMS 3.0.5 ASAP on Monday.
Requires modifications to our RS 3 Configuration!

=== RUN TYPES AND CONFIGURATIONS ===

The required run types are:
1. FED Baseline Calibration With Test DACs (tested at Cornell, not at the TIF)
2. FED Address Level Calibration With Test DACs
3. Emulated Physics (Written, but not tested)

=== NEXT STEPS ===

*Local TTS Testing*

  1. FMM Configuration on frlpcs1d06-38.cms by my "sdas" account but not "pixelpro". Danek is arranging to fix this.
  2. FMM needs SOAP messages like "Configure". From PixelFunctionManager?
  3. Step through the TTS Testing states in PixelFEDSupervisor and confirm communication of the TTS signal from FED -> FMM.
    Need a mock-up PixelConfigDataExamples to configure the FEDs using PixelFEDSupervisor.
    Danek has pointed me to a file that will help me to do this.
  4. LTC Configuration using PixelLTCSupervisor (Danek has already done this once)
  5. Confirm communication of the TTS signal from FED -> FMM -> LTC
  6. Use excessive triggers to generate TTS signal on the FED and see it is recorded on LTC
  
*Global TTS Testing*

  7. Change FMM -> LTC connection to FMM -> Global Trigger Controller
  8. Step through the TTS Testing states from Level 0 Function Manager and make sure GTC gets our TTS signals. Will organize it with Alex Oh.
