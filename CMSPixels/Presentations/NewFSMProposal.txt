Proposal for Finite State Machine Changes
=========================================

Advantages:

1. Calibration procedures can now be pushed into Workloops (threads). 
This allows one to Pause, Resume, Stop, Halt in the middle of calibrations
 (in case baseline drifts too much or calibration is obviously not working).
 
2. At the end of calibrations one arrives in a stable state 
that allows one to press a button to move output files to DB / File 
(instead of the updateFED script).
