Pixel Online Software RCMS - XDAQ Integration Status 6/27/02
------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Pixel Function Manager has been implemented within the 
  Level One Template provided by the RCMS group.
  
  2. It can send SOAP messages to PixelSupervisor
  
	3. Am yet to find out how to send additional parameters 
  with a command 
  (ex. Configure needs a parameter for Configuration Alias)
  
  4. xdaq2rc objects added to PixelSupervisor. 
  Don't know how to receive SOAP messages from Function Manager's end

Alex Oh said he would help me out with 3 & 4 in person tomorrow.

  5. DAQKit 04-02-01 installed in cmsfpix1:/home/souvik
  
  6. TriDAS/pixel ported to 64 bit XDAQ (3.7.3)
  
  7. Updated to the new state machine in PixelSupervisor. 
  (With the "Stop" transition.)
  
  8. Every XDAQ Application must now be within a *group* and a *zone*. 
  CMS Pixels has been assigned zone name "cms.pixel" by the Run Control folks
  I propose we put all the DAQ applications like PixelSupervisor,
  PixelFEC/FED/TKFEC/TTC/Supervisors into the group "daq", 
  and all the DCS applications like PixelDCSSupervisor, 
  PixelDCStoFEDDpInterface into the group "dcs" etc. 
  One application *can* have multiple groups
