Point 5 Status - 13 February 2007
========================

Two outstanding problems remain:

1. FED ID 11 seems to have a stuck bit. This is hinted by:
    a. The FED ID is read as some impossible number because a high bit is stuck,
    b. This FED gives CRC errors in every superfragment.

2. For rates > 500 Hz, events start to go missing in the EVB and EVB throws sync-lost-draining.
    Perhaps due to throttling latency of ~30 BX?
    Maybe we should wait for bug-fixed fixed firmware on the FRLs?
    Helmut is giving us a new firmware.

Christoph will contact us at our next running opportunity.
