So Far:

1. Multiple FED Supervisors can be now supported. My quick fix is to identify XDAQ Application Instance Number = Crate Number
2. Each FED Supervisor can open independent Low Level GUI for each FED on the crate as browser pop-up windows. (Disable pop-up blocking! And enable Javascript)
3. Baseline Calibration has been modified to accomodate these upgrades
4. A skeleton DCS Supervisor given to Angel and Andres which can talk to PixelSupervisor

Next Steps:

1. Modify Address Level and Gain Calibration algorithms
2. Integration with RCMS
3. PSX messages to PVSS from DCS Supervisor
