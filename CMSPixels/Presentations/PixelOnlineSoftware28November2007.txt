=== Problems in Spy FIFO 3 Data ===

1. Lots of 0x0, 0x0, 0x0... 0x0 events, especially at high frequencies (prescale < 1000)
2. FED ID corrupted in SLink Header
3. One junk work between a SLink Trailer and SLink Header

Was not polling the 31st bit of the Central Chip's Control Register.
Added a method in PixelFEDInterface to do that with Danek and Will's email and help.
Now it seems 1 and 2 are gone.
I've seen one instance of 3... am trying to do an organised test.
